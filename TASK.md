# Task definition

In this project it is required to implement a program for drawing common types of charts (pie charts,
histograms, scatterplots, etc.). The input to the program must be the required type of diagram, given in
appropriate format (including both the data itself and the names for the chart components)
and the name of the PNG file to save the result. The program should draw the chart in the graphics window
and save the result to a file.

It is required to independently develop and describe a custom
program interface, input and output data formats, organize testing,
provide sets of files to check the correctness of the implementation and demonstrate examples of work.
